# Overview
I put this together to demonstrate some basic AI programming stuff to colleagues.  Nothing too fancy, but as Product Manager and not a professional software developer, I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.  

# Setup
Current setup is to develop on my local machine and then zip up and send to an aws ecs instance.  The ecs instance runs in a standard public vpc.
